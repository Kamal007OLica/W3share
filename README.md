## **What‚Äôs Inside?** üß∞

This repository contains the code and documentation for a decentralized application that allows users to securely store and retrieve data using IPFS and blockchain. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll find:

- **Frontend**: A responsive and user-friendly interface built with **Next.js**.
- **Backend**: API routes for handling file uploads and interactions with IPFS and blockchain.
- **Smart Contracts**: Ethereum-based smart contracts for managing data storage and retrieval.
- **IPFS Integration**: Secure file storage using **web3.storage** and IPFS.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Immutable record-keeping using Ethereum or other blockchain networks.

---

## **How It Works** ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Client Interaction**:
   - Users interact with the **Next.js** frontend to upload files or retrieve data.
   - The frontend sends **API requests** to the backend for processing.

2. **File Upload**:
   - Files are uploaded via a **POST request** to `/api/uploadData`.
   - The backend uses **web3.storage** to store the file on **IPFS** and retrieves the **IPFS Hash**.

3. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - The **IPFS Hash** is stored in a **smart contract** on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency.
   - Users can retrieve their files using the IPFS Hash stored on the blockchain.

4. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Users can fetch their files by querying the blockchain for the IPFS Hash and retrieving the file from IPFS.

# W3Share - Decentralized Data Storage with IPFS and Blockchain üåê

## Overview

W3Share is a cutting-edge decentralized application (dApp) designed to revolutionize data storage by combining the power of **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)** and **Blockchain** technology. Built with **Next.js**, this project offers a secure, tamper-proof solution for storing and retrieving data. Users can upload files, store them on **web3.storage (IPFS)**, and register the IPFS hash on the blockchain through smart contracts, ensuring data integrity and transparency.

---

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Storage**: Leverage IPFS via **web3.storage** for secure and distributed data storage.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Immutably store file hashes on the blockchain for enhanced security and transparency.
- **Next.js Backend API**: Efficiently handle file uploads and interact with IPFS.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily upload and retrieve files through a seamless client-side experience.
- **Tamper-Proof Records**: Ensure data integrity and verify ownership with blockchain-backed records.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js**: A powerful framework for building the API and client-side interface.
- **web3.storage**: A decentralized storage solution based on IPFS.
- **Smart Contracts**: Blockchain-based mechanisms for recording and verifying data.
- **Ethereum / Polygon**: Blockchain networks used for storing IPFS hashes.

---

## How It Works

1. **Client Interaction**: Users interact with the application through a web interface.
