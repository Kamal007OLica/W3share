#**Decentralized Data Storage with IPFS and Blockchain** 🌐

Welcome to my **Decentralized Application (dApp)** repository! This project leverages **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)** and **Blockchain Technology** to create a secure, decentralized data storage solution. Built with **Next.js** and integrated with **web3.storage**, this dApp ensures data integrity, transparency, and immutability while providing a seamless user experience.

---

## **What’s Inside?** 🧰

This repository contains the code and documentation for a decentralized application that allows users to securely store and retrieve data using IPFS and blockchain. Here’s what you’ll find:

- **Frontend**: A responsive and user-friendly interface built with **Next.js**.
- **Backend**: API routes for handling file uploads and interactions with IPFS and blockchain.
- **Smart Contracts**: Ethereum-based smart contracts for managing data storage and retrieval.
- **IPFS Integration**: Secure file storage using **web3.storage** and IPFS.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Immutable record-keeping using Ethereum or other blockchain networks.

---

## **How It Works** ⚙️

1. **Client Interaction**:
   - Users interact with the **Next.js** frontend to upload files or retrieve data.
   - The frontend sends **API requests** to the backend for processing.

2. **File Upload**:
   - Files are uploaded via a **POST request** to `/api/uploadData`.
   - The backend uses **web3.storage** to store the file on **IPFS** and retrieves the **IPFS Hash**.

3. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - The **IPFS Hash** is stored in a **smart contract** on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency.
   - Users can retrieve their files using the IPFS Hash stored on the blockchain.

4. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Users can fetch their files by querying the blockchain for the IPFS Hash and retrieving the file from IPFS.

## **Tech Stack** 🛠️

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React-based framework)
- **Backend**: Node.js (API routes in Next.js)
- **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS (via web3.storage)
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Smart Contracts)
- **APIs**: RESTful API for file uploads and retrieval

---

## **Key Features** ✨

- **Decentralized Storage**: Files are stored on IPFS, ensuring redundancy and accessibility.
- **Immutable Records**: IPFS Hashes are stored on the blockchain, providing a tamper-proof record of file ownership.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive frontend built with Next.js.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large files and high traffic with ease.
